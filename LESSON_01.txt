Chapter 1 : Introduction to CSS


Allows to separate your websites [HTML content] from their style.

                        HTML -> arrange content
                        CSS -> style content, presentation


There are 3 ways on how to use CSS: Internal Stylesheet, External Stylesheet and Inline css.


Internal Stylesheet

<head>
<title><title>
<style type=”text/css”>
CSS Content Goes Here
</style>
</head>
<body>



External Stylesheet 

We can link the file by adding this line

<link rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css” href=“Path To stylesheet.css” />
or
<style type=”text/css”> @import url(Path To stylesheet.css) </style>


Here are a few reasons this is better.

Easier Maintenance
Reduced File Size
Reduced Bandwidth
Improved Flexibility



You can have both internal, external and inline style.


<p style=”color: #ff0000;”>Some red text</p>


All the various methods will cascade into a new “pseudo” stylesheet in the following order:

Inline Style (inside (X)HTML element)
Internal Style Sheet (inside the <head> tag)
External Style Sheet


Remember Inline, Internal,External.



As far as which way is better, it depends on what you want to do. If you have only one file to style then placing it within the <head></head> tags (internal) will work fine. Though if you are planning on styling multiple files then the external file method is the way to go.

Choosing between the <link related=> & the @import methods are completely up to you. I will mention that the @import method may take a second longer to read the CSS file in Internet Explorer than the <link related=> option. To combat this see Flash of unstyled content



Users with Disabilities can benefit from externl stylesheets.
